**Official Submission for the Gemini 3 Hackathon | January 2026**

## 🌟 Vision
Laki is a specialized "healing-style" companion app powered by **Gemini 3**. It transforms the traditional AI assistant into a warm, empathetic digital spirit that remembers your long-term emotional journey using Gemini 3's massive context window.

## 🎨 Visual Evolution & UX
We have redesigned the interface to foster a sense of calm and safety:
* **Healing Color Palette**: Replaced harsh contrasts with **Soft Pastels**. The creamy white background and desaturated gradients (Green, Blue, Purple) reduce eye strain and anxiety.
* **Macaron Aesthetic**: Implemented a consistent **24px border-radius** on all interactive elements to create a soft, cloud-like, and non-aggressive visual feel.
* **Refined Typography**: Text color has been updated from solid black to **Soft Charcoal (#4A4A4A)** with opacity variations to provide a gentler reading experience.

## 🚀 Key Features (Powered by Gemini 3)
* **Long-Term Emotional Memory**: Leveraging Gemini 3's **2M+ context window** to remember past conversations and provide deeply personalized emotional support.
* **Multimodal Empathy**: Users can share photos or voice notes, and Laki responds with native multimodal understanding to provide real-time comfort.
* **Reasoning-Driven Support**: Utilizing Gemini 3's **Thinking Mode** to analyze complex interpersonal problems and provide logical yet empathetic guidance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework**: React + Vite + TypeScript
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
* **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 3 API (via Google AI Studio)
